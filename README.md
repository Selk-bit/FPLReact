# Team Selector Application

The Team Selector is a dynamic web application developed using React.js and integrated with Firebase. It is designed to assist in selecting and managing sports players for team compositions effectively and interactively.

## Features

### Player Data Management
- **Detailed Attributes**: Each player comes with attributes such as Name, Team, Price, and Position, allowing for informed selection decisions.

### Interactive Player Selection
- **Add/Remove Players**: Users can dynamically add players to a visual representation of the pitch according to their positions and remove them as needed by clicking the 'X' on their profile.
- **Player Information Cards**: Clicking on a player displays a card with more detailed information, enriching the user's interactive experience.

### Team Restrictions
- **Team Diversity**: Supports two initial teams (Reds and Blues) with functionality to add more. Limits selection to a maximum of three players from the same team to promote diversity.

### Add New Players
- **Player Addition**: Users can add new players to the database via the `/add` route using a simple form.

## Responsive Design
- The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
